					<p>The history of the University of Newcastle, as for all great universities, has been characterised by leaders who have been willing to challenge the status quo and transform fields of education and research.</p>
					
					<p>Since its foundation, the staff, students and leaders of the University have introduced unique ways of thinking and operating that have led to remarkable outcomes.</p>

						<p>The University of Newcastle began as a college of the University of New South Wales. It opened in late 1951 and accepted its first students in 1952.</p>

The staff and students of the Newcastle University college shared cramped conditions with their Technical College colleagues. Space was at such a premium that one lecturer's office was his car; another lecturer, Dr Beryl Nashar, was accommodated with a flimsy partition in the typing pool.</p>
						<p>The community had campaigned for a University since the 1940s. While the Newcastle University College offered a university education in the region, the community wanted more. They campaigned throughout the 50s to get it.</p>
						<p>In 1962, the Vice-Chancellor of UNSW, Sir Philip Baxter, finally relented. Work began on transforming the fledgling college to a university in the full sense.</p>
